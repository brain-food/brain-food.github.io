Brain_Food was made to provide students with a quick resource for healthy eating ideas, and to give students at UH Manoa information on how to buy healthy foods and ingredients near campus.\r\n\r\nAs the average college student has limited time and financial means to support healthy eating in the name of brainpower, Brain_Food also lists both the estimated time needed to follow a recipe from stat to finish, and the estimated cost of recipe ingredients.\r\n\r\nUse Brain_Food and activate your brain's beast mode!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\nThese are a few screenshots of the application's mockup design\r\n\r\n### Landing Page\r\n![Landing Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brain-food/brain-food.github.io/master/doc/01Landing.png)\r\n\r\n### About Brain Food \r\n![About](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brain-food/brain-food.github.io/master/doc/02About.png)\r\n\r\n### Food List Page\r\n![Food List](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brain-food/brain-food.github.io/master/doc/03FoodList.png)\r\n\r\n### Recipe Page\r\n![Recipe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brain-food/brain-food.github.io/master/doc/04FoodItem.png)\r\n\r\n### Vendors\r\n![Vendors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brain-food/brain-food.github.io/master/doc/05FoodHunt.png)",
